      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a strategic thinker and execution-driven professional with cross-functional experience in product and project management. With hands-on experience in building products from 0 to 1, managing agile sprints, and collaborating with stakeholders across engineering, design, and business, I bring clarity to chaos and structure to scale. My background in tech and passion for user-first innovation fuels my mission to solve real problems while aligning team efforts with business goals.</p>

      <h2>Case Studies & Projects</h2>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>International Labelling App | Adidas (via Infosys)</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Senior Systems Engineer | <strong>Focus:</strong> Feature Ownership, Agile Execution, Stakeholder Collaboration</p>
        <p>Tasked with delivering a compliance-driven labelling system, I owned a critical feature module for auto-generating regulatory-compliant labels. With no prior implementation in place, I scoped the requirements, led technical feasibility analysis, coordinated with QA, and delivered the feature across global environments. The feature reduced manual errors by 80% and was later used as a blueprint for upcoming localizations.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Smart Spending Application</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Full Stack Developer | <strong>Focus:</strong> Data Visualization, Feature Design, UX Collaboration</p>
        <p>I led the development of an intuitive dashboard that visualized user spending trends and categorized transactions. Worked on backend API integration and frontend visual summaries, improving financial decision-making for users. This project exemplifies my ability to bridge technical execution with product functionality.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Advanced Job Portal | Perimattic Pvt Ltd</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Associate Product Manager | <strong>Focus:</strong> Product Strategy, User Research, Feature Prioritization</p>
        <p>From problem discovery to PRD creation, I led the initiative for a job portal with built-in ATS. Mapped candidate-recruiter workflows, created wireframes, defined MVP scope, and ran sprint cycles with the dev team. Though the product wasn't launched, I gained critical experience in B2B product planning and validation.</p>

        <h3>Educational Platform Suite | Seekho 360</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Freelance Project Manager | <strong>Focus:</strong> Roadmapping, Cross-functional Team Leadership</p>
        <p>Oversaw the simultaneous development of three educational products. I facilitated standups, resolved blockers, documented scope changes, and aligned stakeholders toward timelines. Key takeaway: a PM’s impact is in how well they communicate risks, keep momentum, and document decisions.</p>
